## Sources

- [CentOS Linux](https://www.centos.org/centos-linux/)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- CentOS Linux has no upgrade path to CentOS Stream; plan a rebuild or a migration to another distribution.
- Confirm application packages and repositories exist for the target platform before rebuilding.

**Steps**

1. **Replace the CentOS host.** Rebuild the host on CentOS Stream or a distribution with a published lifecycle, then redeploy the workload.

**Verification**

- `cat /etc/centos-release`: Confirm the host reports the target CentOS release.
- `dnf check-update`: Check that package updates resolve on the target release.
