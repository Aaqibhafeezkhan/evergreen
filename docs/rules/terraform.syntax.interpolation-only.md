# Interpolation-only strings are deprecated

**Deprecated.** The source gives no day. Replacement: The same expression without the surrounding quotes, such as var.name. Source: [hashicorp/terraform release v0.12.14](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.12.14).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/terraform
```

Terraform v0.12.14 deprecated a string whose whole value is one interpolation, such as "${var.name}": the same value is written as the bare expression var.name. Terraform still accepts the quoted form but recommends the bare expression for readability, and terraform fmt repairs simple examples. A string that mixes text with an interpolation, such as "prefix-${var.name}", is not the deprecated form and still needs its quotes.

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Rewrite only a string whose entire value is one ${ ... } interpolation. A string with any literal text, a %{ ... } directive, or an escape sequence must keep its quotes.
- Do not remove the quotes from an object key or a block label: those strings are not expressions, and the bare form would not be valid HCL.
- Each rewrite is a syntactic one-to-one change with the same expression inside the interpolation, so plan output should not change.

**Steps**

1. **Replace the quoted interpolation with its expression.** Change `value = "${var.name}"` to `value = var.name`, keeping the expression exactly as written inside the interpolation.
2. **Repair the other interpolation-only strings.** Repeat for every string in *.tf that contains exactly one interpolation and no other text. Run terraform fmt to catch simple examples the codemod did not rewrite.

**Verification**

- `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`: Initialize without touching remote state and check that the rewritten expressions are valid HCL.
- `terraform plan`: Confirm the rewrite evaluates to the same values and the plan is unchanged.
