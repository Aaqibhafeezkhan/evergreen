## Migration

**Constraints**

- Use Leapp or the supported in-place upgrade path, or rebuild the host on the target major release.
- Extended Life Cycle Support is a separate paid subscription; do not count it as standard maintenance.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade the RHEL host.** Move the host to a supported RHEL major release, confirm subscriptions and third-party packages, then drain and return it to service.

**Verification**

- `cat /etc/redhat-release`: Confirm the host reports the target RHEL release.
- `dnf check-update`: Check that package updates resolve on the target release.
