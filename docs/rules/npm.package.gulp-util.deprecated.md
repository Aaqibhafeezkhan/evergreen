## Sources

- [gulp-util package deprecation notice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-util)
- [gulp-util registry metadata](https://registry.npmjs.org/gulp-util/latest)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve each used utility's logging, file, plugin-error, and stream behavior.

**Steps**

1. **Inventory gulp-util APIs.** Map every imported gulp-util member to the purpose-specific replacement recommended by Gulp.
2. **Install focused replacements.** Replace gulp-util imports and dependency with only the maintained modules required by those usages.

**Verification**

- `npm run build --if-present`: Run the Gulp build and verify task output.
