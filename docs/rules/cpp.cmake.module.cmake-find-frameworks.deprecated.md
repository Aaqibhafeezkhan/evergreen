## Sources

- [CMakeFindFrameworks module documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CMakeFindFrameworks.html)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve the framework search paths and the library names the project already expects when rewriting calls to find_library().

**Steps**

1. **Replace CMakeFindFrameworks with find_library.** Remove include(CMakeFindFrameworks) / cmake_find_frameworks() and locate the same frameworks with find_library().

**Verification**

- `cmake -S . -B build -Wdev`: Configure with developer warnings and confirm the CMP0173 deprecation is gone.
