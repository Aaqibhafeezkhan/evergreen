## Sources

- [Node 20 is no longer available in GitHub Actions](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-09-23-node-20-is-no-longer-available-in-github-actions/)
- [actions/stale v10.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/actions/stale/releases/tag/v10.0.0)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve the stale and close timing, exempt labels, and operations-per-run limits when upgrading.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade stale.** Change the uses reference to actions/stale@v10 or a later supported major.
2. **Review stale inputs.** Compare configured inputs with the target release and update renamed or changed options; confirm the runner meets the release's minimum version.

**Verification**

- `git diff --check`: Validate the edited workflow diff.
