## Sources

- [What's New in Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep the behavior of the call unchanged; check the replacement's argument and return-type differences.

**Steps**

1. **Use onexc.** Rename onerror to onexc and change the handler to take (function, path, exception) instead of (function, path, exc_info).

**Verification**

- `python -W error::DeprecationWarning -m pytest`: Run the tests with deprecation warnings as errors when pytest is used.
