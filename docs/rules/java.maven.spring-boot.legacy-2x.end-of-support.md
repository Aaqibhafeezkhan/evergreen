# Spring Boot 2.x is out of open-source support

**End of support.** The source gives no day. Replacement: Spring Boot 4.1.x. Source: [Spring Boot support policy](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:maven/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot
```

Spring Boot 2.x no longer receives regular open-source releases. Spring Boot 2.7 had an extended commercial support period, which is distinct from community OSS support. Upgrade to a supported Spring Boot 4.x line and follow the 2.x-to-3.x and 3.x-to-4.x migration guidance.

## Sources

- [Spring Boot support policy](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Spring Boot 2.7's extended commercial support does not mean the 2.x line remains in community open-source support.
- Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17 or later and includes the Jakarta EE namespace migration; complete the 2.x-to-3.x changes before moving to 4.x.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade to a supported 3.x baseline first.** Follow the official Spring Boot 3 migration guide, move to Java 17 or later, and migrate Java EE javax APIs to their Jakarta equivalents where required.
2. **Move to a supported 4.x release.** Follow the Spring Boot 4 migration guide, align Spring Framework and managed dependencies, and remove configuration deprecated by the intermediate releases.

**Verification**

- `./mvnw -B verify || ./gradlew build`: Build and run the project's tests after the upgrade.
- `./mvnw -B dependency:tree || ./gradlew dependencies`: Check that the resolved dependency graph uses a consistent supported Spring Boot line.
