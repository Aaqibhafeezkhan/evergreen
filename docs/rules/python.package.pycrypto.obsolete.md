# PyCrypto is obsolete and vulnerable

**End of life** as of 2022-01-27. Replacement: pycryptodome or cryptography. Source: [Archived PyCrypto repository warning](https://github.com/pycrypto/pycrypto).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:pypi/pycrypto
```

The archived project warns that PyCrypto 2.x is unmaintained, obsolete, and contains security vulnerabilities.

## Sources

- [Archived PyCrypto repository warning](https://github.com/pycrypto/pycrypto)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Treat this as a security-sensitive migration: preserve algorithms, modes, key sizes, padding, nonces or IVs, authentication tags, and serialized ciphertext formats.
- Do not silently change cryptographic primitives or defaults without explicit compatibility and security review.

**Steps**

1. **Choose the maintained library.** Select pycryptodome for a closer Crypto namespace migration or cryptography for a higher-level maintained interface.
2. **Migrate cryptographic usages.** Update every reported import and operation, making keys, modes, padding, nonces, tags, and encoding explicit.
3. **Replace the dependency.** Remove pycrypto, add the selected maintained package, and regenerate the environment lock data.
4. **Verify cryptographic test vectors.** Confirm known plaintext/ciphertext vectors and backward compatibility with persisted encrypted data.

**Verification**

- `python -m pytest`: Run cryptographic vectors and repository tests.
- `python -m pip check`: Check installed dependency compatibility.
