## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep every module, version catalog entry, and BOM override on one Play Billing Library major that Google Play still accepts for new apps and updates.
- Major upgrades of com.android.billingclient:billing can require BillingClient API changes; read the Play Billing Library migration guide for the jump from the reported major to the replacement before shipping.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the Play Billing Library dependency.** Change the reported com.android.billingclient:billing version to Google Play Billing Library 8.x or 9.x (see the replacement) in the build.gradle(.kts) dependency (or the version catalog key that supplies it).
2. **Align other Play Billing declarations.** Update every other Gradle module, libs.versions.toml entry, and dependency-management block that still pins the old major, and adjust BillingClient call sites the migration guide names for that jump.

**Verification**

- `./gradlew assembleDebug`: Build a debug APK with the raised Play Billing Library major.
- `./gradlew dependencies`: Confirm the resolved Play Billing Library major matches the intended replacement.
