## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve the requested Python version, caching, and architecture inputs when upgrading.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade setup-python.** Change the uses reference to actions/setup-python@v6 or a later supported major.
2. **Review setup-python inputs.** Compare configured inputs with the target release and update renamed or changed options; confirm the runner meets the release's minimum version.

**Verification**

- `git diff --check`: Validate the edited workflow diff.
