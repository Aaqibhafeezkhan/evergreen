# Go 1.20 and older are no longer supported

The Go release policy supports a major release until two newer major releases exist. Go 1.20 support ended when Go 1.22 was released, and every older release lost support before that.

## Sources

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep go.mod, go.work, CI matrices, and container images on one supported Go release.
- Check that every dependency's own go directive is compatible with the target toolchain.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the Go version.** Raise the reported `go` or `toolchain` line from Go 1.20 or older to a supported release (see the replacement), for example with `go get go@<version> toolchain@<version>`.
2. **Align other Go version surfaces.** Update CI setup-go versions, Dockerfile `golang:` images, and other go.mod or go.work files in the repository so they agree.

**Verification**

- `go version`: Confirm the active toolchain is the intended release.
- `go build ./... && go test ./...`: Build and test every package on the new release.
- `go vet ./...`: Catch problems the newer release reports.
