## Sources

- [q package deprecation notice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/q)
- [q registry metadata](https://registry.npmjs.org/q/latest)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve fulfillment and rejection timing, chaining, progress behavior where used, error propagation, and cancellation assumptions.

**Steps**

1. **Audit Q-specific behavior.** Identify Q-only APIs and semantic assumptions before translating promise chains.
2. **Use native promises.** Rewrite Q construction, combinators, and chains with native Promise and async/await equivalents, then remove q.

**Verification**

- `npm run test --if-present`: Run asynchronous success, rejection, ordering, and repository tests.
