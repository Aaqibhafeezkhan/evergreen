# .NET

The `dotnet` detector reports .NET release lines that no longer receive fixes, in the SDK a repository pins and in the target frameworks of its projects, and direct NuGet dependencies their publisher has deprecated. It reads `global.json`, project files, `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, and `packages.lock.json`. It is **beta** ([decision 0013](../decisions/0013-detector-maturity.md)): it is scored on the [public corpus](../VALIDATION.md) and held to the 0.95 precision floor, and a change to one of its rule ids, finding ids, or documented declaration forms is listed in the changelog. The reasoning for the detector is in [Decision 0012](../decisions/0012-dotnet-detector.md).

## What it reads

| File | Declaration |
| --- | --- |
| `global.json` | `sdk.version` |
| `*.csproj`, `*.fsproj`, `*.vbproj`, `Directory.Build.props` | `TargetFramework` and `TargetFrameworks` (a semicolon list, one declaration per entry) in a `PropertyGroup` |
| `*.csproj`, `*.fsproj`, `*.vbproj` | `PackageReference` items, with the version from the `Version` attribute or a `<Version>` child |
| `Directory.Packages.props` | `PackageVersion` items (central package management) |
| `packages.lock.json` | the resolved version of each `"type": "Direct"` dependency |
| `*.cs` | `using` directives and calls of deprecated packages, to list the files a migration touches |

It walks the repository up to eight directories deep (at most 500 matching files) and does not follow symbolic links. It skips `.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `bin`, `obj`, `target`, `.venv`, `venv`, `fixtures`, `__fixtures__`, and `testdata`. The `dotnet` CLI is never run and MSBuild is never evaluated.

## What it reports

- An SDK pin or a target framework on a release line that is past its end of support under the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core), at **high** severity. An SDK `X.Y.Z` belongs to the line `X.Y`, so `3.1.426` is the 3.1 line. `netcoreapp3.1`, `net5.0`, and `net6.0-windows` are read as the lines 3.1, 5.0, and 6.0. The rules cover 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 today; .NET Core 3.0 and older are named ".NET Core X.Y" in the findings.
- A line whose end Microsoft has announced but that has not happened yet (.NET 8 and 9, 2026-11-10) as a `scheduled-end-of-life` finding at **low** severity, so a severity gate set to `high` does not fail on a date that is still ahead. When the date has passed, a reviewed change turns the rule into the end-of-support rule with the same id ([decision 0010](../decisions/0010-scheduled-end-of-life.md)).
- A direct `PackageReference` or `PackageVersion` on a NuGet package whose publisher deprecated every version as legacy, at **medium** severity. The registry has four such rules today: `WindowsAzure.Storage` and `Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob` (replaced by the `Azure.Storage.*` packages), `Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB` (replaced by `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos`), and `Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus` (replaced by `Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus`).
- A `Direct` entry in `packages.lock.json`, only for a rule that names specific versions. A package deprecated at every version is reported once, where it is declared.
- For the package rule, the `.cs` files that import or call it, with an impact summary.

Each finding carries its rule's source, replacement, migration steps, and verification commands (`dotnet build && dotnet test`).

## What it intentionally does not judge

- `netstandard2.0` and `netstandard2.1` are API specifications, not runtimes, and have no end of life. They are ignored.
- .NET Framework targets (`net48`, `net472`, ...) follow the Windows lifecycle, not the .NET policy. They are listed as unclassified.
- An MSBuild property (`$(TargetFramework)`, `Version="$(Ver)"`), a floating version (`1.*`), and a version range (`[1.0,2.0)`) cannot be decided without evaluating MSBuild. They are listed as unclassified with their file and line, never guessed.
- Anything under an element or group with a `Condition`, and anything set through `<Import>` or inherited from a file Evergreen is not looking at, is skipped.
- A `PackageReference` with no version is unclassified, unless central package management (`ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` set to `true`) is enabled in its directory or above, where the version is judged in `Directory.Packages.props`.
- A `global.json` without `sdk.version`, a version that is not a number, and a version under `msbuild-sdks` (which belongs to a build SDK package, not to .NET) pin no SDK.
- Malformed or oversized files (over 1 MiB) produce nothing, not partial results. A `global.json` may contain comments but not a trailing comma.
- A `dotnet-version` given to `actions/setup-dotnet` and a `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/*` base image in a Dockerfile name a runtime too, but this detector does not read workflows or Dockerfiles, so an end-of-support line that appears only there is not reported. The finding for the project file or `global.json` of the same repository is.

## Known limits and false-positive boundaries

- A target framework is a statement about what the project builds for. A library can multi-target an old line on purpose; Evergreen reports the declaration and cannot know the intent. A `global.json` SDK pin names the toolchain that builds the repository, which is closer to the truth.
- A sample, test, or tool project in a repository that still targets an old line is reported like any other project.
- Source usage is found for `.cs` files only. `using` directives, aliases, `global using`, a type reached by its full name, and a type reached by its simple name when its own namespace is imported are found. A method called on an instance (`account.CreateCloudBlobClient()`) is not, `using static` binds no name, F# and Visual Basic sources are not read, and a verbatim string that ends in a backslash can confuse the masking of strings and comments.

## Data

The rules are in `registry/dotnet.json` and ship in the [data bundle](../DATA.md). The importers `dotnet-1` (the official releases index) and `dotnet-2` (NuGet deprecation metadata for a reviewed list of packages) draft new rules for review; see [Lifecycle importers](../IMPORTERS.md).

## Validation

Eighteen public repositories at pinned commits are in the corpus, scored by every detector. Six were chosen knowing their result (`selection: "targeted"`): four that targeted a past-support line or depended on a deprecated package until their maintainers moved on (Sloth, Sharp.BlobStorage, sourcelink, machinery), one whose test projects target .NET 8 and so carry the scheduled low-severity finding (xunit.analyzers), and one with no findings (LibreAutomate, which targets `net10.0-windows`). Twelve were chosen by a rule fixed before Evergreen ran on them (`selection: "blind"`), described in [Validation](../VALIDATION.md#net-blind-selection). Eight of them have no finding because they target .NET Framework or `netstandard`, which this detector does not judge. Four have findings: Ceras (`netcoreapp2.1` and `2.2`, which had no rule until this change, so the first scan of it missed them), DlibDotNet (`netcoreapp2.0`, `2.1`, and `3.1`), Chrome-Developer-Mode-Extension-Warning-Patcher (`net6.0`), and SharpSocks (`net5.0` and `net6.0`).

Across the eighteen repositories there are 84 expected `dotnet` findings, all matched. For the twelve blind repositories, the target frameworks, SDK pins, and package references were listed by hand and compared with the report: every judged form was reported and nothing else was (the 50 findings in DlibDotNet are 46 `netcoreapp2.0`, two `netcoreapp2.1`, and two `netcoreapp3.1` declarations, counted independently of Evergreen). Recall is therefore measured on the forms in "What it reads" only; the unjudged forms listed above are outside it, and the blind sample shows they matter: two of the twelve repositories name a runtime in a workflow or Dockerfile that is not read. The counts, selection, and precision floor are the evidence behind the `beta` level in `benchmarks/thresholds.json`.
