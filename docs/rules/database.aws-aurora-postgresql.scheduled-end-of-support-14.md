- [Using Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/extended-support.html)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- A major version upgrade on RDS or Aurora is a separate maintenance action; RDS does not apply it automatically, and changing the engine version back is not a rollback.
- Take a snapshot before a major version upgrade: the change cannot be undone in place.
- Extended Support keeps the instance or cluster running past the end of standard support for a fee; it does not replace moving to a supported major.

**Steps**

1. **Take a snapshot.** Take a manual RDS snapshot of every reported instance or cluster and verify that it can be restored.
2. **Upgrade to a supported major.** Upgrade with ModifyDBInstance or ModifyDBCluster and AllowMajorVersionUpgrade, or restore the snapshot into a new instance or cluster on Aurora PostgreSQL 16 or later and move the application connection string to it.
3. **Raise the declared version.** Change engine_version in every aws_db_instance, aws_rds_cluster, Compose, and Helm value that runs this database, not only the reported object.
4. **Check clients and extensions.** Update database drivers, ORMs, extensions, and parameter groups that assume the old major version.

**Verification**

- `terraform plan`: Review the plan and confirm the engine_version change is intended and is the only database change.
- `docker compose config`: Confirm any local Compose service that mirrors this database is valid and uses an image tag that matches Aurora PostgreSQL 16 or later.
- `aws rds describe-db-clusters --query "DBClusters[?Engine=='aurora-postgresql'].[DBClusterIdentifier,EngineVersion]" --output table`: Confirm each reported DB cluster now reports a supported engine version.
