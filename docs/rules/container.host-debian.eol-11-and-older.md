## Sources

- [Debian Long Term Support](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Follow the Debian release notes across every intermediate release; do not skip a major release.
- Confirm third-party repositories and held packages support the target release before upgrading.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade the Debian host.** Move the host to a supported Debian release with the documented upgrade procedure, or rebuild it and redeploy the workload.

**Verification**

- `cat /etc/debian_version`: Confirm the host reports the target Debian release.
- `apt-get -s upgrade`: Check that package upgrades resolve on the target release.
