# v0.1 validation

Evergreen v0.1 was validated on 2026-10-14 against 20 public repositories pinned to immutable commits: ten Node.js repositories, nine Python repositories, and one Node.js/GitHub Actions repository. The complete corpus and expected finding locations live in `benchmarks/public-repositories.json`; the executable harness is `benchmarks/public-repositories.ts`.

## Results

| Measure | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Repositories | 20 |
| Expected findings | 27 |
| True positives | 27 |
| False positives | 0 |
| False negatives | 0 |
| Precision | 1.0000 |
| Recall | 1.0000 |
| Median scan time | 8.19 ms |
| p95 scan time | 48.88 ms |
| Slowest scan | 49.73 ms |

Scan time measures only local Evergreen analysis after checkout. It excludes network and Git operations. The run used the development machine, so duration is a reference rather than a cross-machine guarantee.

## Method

Every expected result is identified by rule ID, repository-relative path, and line at a pinned commit. The harness downloads each commit to a temporary directory, runs all built-in detectors, compares sets in both directions, reports per-repository timing, and removes the checkout. It exits unsuccessfully for any unexpected or missing finding.

```bash
npm run validate:public-repos
```

The audit covers both positive and zero-finding repositories across npm/Node.js, Python, and GitHub Actions. Findings were checked against their repository declarations and the authoritative sources bundled with the matching lifecycle rule.

## Interpretation and limits

Precision and recall are measured only against Evergreen's documented v0.1 rule set and the pinned corpus. They do not mean Evergreen detects every possible deprecation in these ecosystems. The corpus is public and reproducible, but not a statistically representative sample of all software. Dynamic action references and unsupported ecosystems remain intentionally unclassified.

The controlled source-usage benchmark provides a separate exact-match test for imports, calls, and configuration keys; see [Benchmarks](BENCHMARKS.md).
