## Sources

- [protractor package deprecation notice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor)
- [protractor registry metadata](https://registry.npmjs.org/protractor/latest)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve end-to-end coverage, browser matrix, selectors, waits, authentication state, screenshots, retries, and CI artifacts.

**Steps**

1. **Select a maintained end-to-end runner.** Choose a maintained runner that supports the browsers, environments, and test capabilities the suite requires.
2. **Migrate the Protractor suite.** Translate configuration, page objects, selectors, waits, assertions, and CI commands incrementally to the selected runner.

**Verification**

- `npm run test --if-present`: Run the migrated end-to-end suite and repository tests.
