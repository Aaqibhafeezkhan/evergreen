## Sources

- [Supported Kubernetes versions in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- AKS upgrades one minor version at a time and upgrades the control plane before the agent pools.
- Long-term support is opt-in per cluster; without it, a version stops receiving patches at the end of its 12-month support window.
- An agent pool cannot run a newer version than its control plane, so raise the control plane and the pools together.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the cluster version.** Set kubernetes_version to the release in the replacement, then run terraform plan and apply the control-plane upgrade.
2. **Raise the agent pools.** Raise each azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool orchestrator_version so the agent pools match the new control plane.
3. **Remove APIs the new version deleted.** Read the Kubernetes deprecation guide for every minor version crossed and replace removed API versions in manifests and Helm charts before applying.

**Verification**

- `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`: Initialize without touching remote state and check that the configuration is valid.
- `terraform plan`: Review the plan and confirm the control-plane and agent-pool changes are the intended ones.
- `az aks show --resource-group <group> --name <cluster> --query kubernetesVersion`: Confirm the control plane reports the new version.
- `kubectl version`: Confirm kubectl and the API server agree on the version.
