# GKE 1.29 and earlier clusters are no longer supported

**End of life.** The source gives no day. Replacement: GKE 1.35 or later. Source: [GKE versioning and support](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/google-gke
```

The GKE release schedule states that GKE 1.29 and earlier have reached end of support and are no longer supported.

## Sources

- [GKE versioning and support](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning)
- [GKE release schedule](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-schedule)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- GKE upgrades one minor version at a time and may auto-upgrade a cluster whose version reaches end of support.
- Only a cluster in the Extended channel keeps receiving security patches past the end of standard support.
- Node pools and the control plane must be on compatible versions, so raise both in the same change.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the control-plane version.** Raise the cluster's Kubernetes version to a supported release, or let its release channel do it.
2. **Raise the node pools.** Raise every node pool to a compatible version, or let the release channel manage it.
3. **Remove APIs the new version deleted.** Read the Kubernetes deprecation guide for every minor version crossed and replace removed API versions before applying.

**Verification**

- `kubectl version`: Confirm the API server and kubectl agree on the new version.
- `kubectl get nodes -o wide`: Confirm every node runs a compatible version.
