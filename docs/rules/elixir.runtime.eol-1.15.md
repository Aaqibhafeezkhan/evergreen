# Elixir 1.15 no longer receives security updates

**End of life** as of 2026-06-03. Replacement: Elixir 1.16 or later. Source: [Elixir security policy](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/security/policy).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/elixir
```

Elixir's security policy provides security patches only for the five most recent minor branches. Elixir 1.15 left that window when Elixir 1.20 shipped on 2026-06-03, so the branch no longer receives security patches from the Elixir project.

## Sources

- [Elixir security policy](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/security/policy)
- [Elixir v1.20.0 release](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases/tag/v1.20.0)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep .tool-versions, mix.exs elixir:, CI setup-beam versions, and container images on one supported Elixir release line that the chosen Erlang/OTP also supports.
- Confirm Hex dependencies compile on the target Elixir and re-resolve with mix deps.get after changing the runtime.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the Elixir version.** Change the reported declaration from Elixir 1.15 to a supported release (see the replacement), using the project's existing version manager.
2. **Align other Elixir version surfaces.** Update mix.exs elixir:, .tool-versions, CI setup-beam versions, and Dockerfile elixir images so they agree.

**Verification**

- `elixir --version`: Confirm the active Elixir runtime is the intended release.
- `mix deps.get && mix compile`: Re-resolve dependencies and compile on the new Elixir.
- `mix test`: Run the Mix test suite on the new Elixir.
