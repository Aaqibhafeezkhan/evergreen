## Sources

- [natives package deprecation notice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natives)
- [natives registry metadata](https://registry.npmjs.org/natives/latest)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve filesystem behavior, retry semantics, and compatibility with the Node.js versions supported by the project.

**Steps**

1. **Replace natives.** Replace the natives dependency and imports with graceful-fs 4.x, using its public filesystem API instead of Node.js internals.
2. **Verify filesystem behavior.** Exercise affected file operations, including concurrent access and error paths, on every supported Node.js version.

**Verification**

- `npm run test --if-present`: Run filesystem behavior and repository tests when defined.
