## Sources

- [figgy-pudding package deprecation notice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figgy-pudding)
- [figgy-pudding registry metadata](https://registry.npmjs.org/figgy-pudding/latest)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve option defaults, validation, inheritance, provider lookup, key enumeration, and sensitive-value handling.

**Steps**

1. **Replace configuration wrappers.** Replace figgy-pudding instances with explicit validated configuration objects or a maintained configuration library, then remove the package.

**Verification**

- `npm run test --if-present`: Run configuration defaults, validation, inheritance, and repository tests.
