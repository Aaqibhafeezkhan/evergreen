## Migration

**Constraints**

- Amazon Linux 2023 is a separate major release: rebuild the host rather than upgrading in place.
- Confirm installed packages and agents are available for Amazon Linux 2023 before switching.

**Steps**

1. **Replace the Amazon Linux host.** Launch a replacement host on Amazon Linux 2023 from the same configuration, then move traffic to it.

**Verification**

- `cat /etc/system-release`: Confirm the host reports Amazon Linux 2023.
- `dnf check-update`: Check that package updates resolve on the new host.
