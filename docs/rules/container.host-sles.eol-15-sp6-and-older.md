# SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 and older are past general support

**End of life** as of 2025-12-31. Replacement: SLES 15 SP7 or SLES 16. Source: [SUSE product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/sles
```

General support ended for SLES 15 SP6 on 2025-12-31, SP5 on 2024-12-31, and SP4 on 2023-12-31, and for SP3 and older earlier. Long Term Service Pack Support is a separate paid add-on; SLES 15 SP7 and SLES 16 remain in general support.

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Use the supported service-pack migration path, or rebuild the host on the target service pack.
- Long Term Service Pack Support is a separate paid add-on; do not count it as general support.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade the SLES host.** Move the host to a supported SLES service pack, confirm subscriptions and third-party packages, then return it to service.

**Verification**

- `cat /etc/os-release`: Confirm the host reports the target SLES service pack.
- `zypper refresh`: Check that the target repositories are configured and reachable.
