# Inventory

`evergreen inventory` reads the JSON or text exports that cloud and cluster tools already produce and reports what they say is deployed: end-of-life runtimes, images, engines, cluster versions, and operating systems. Each result carries the importer, the file, and the exact place in the file the claim rests on, as an RFC 6901 JSON Pointer.

Evergreen never calls a cloud or cluster API. You run the export command on a machine with credentials, then give the file to `evergreen inventory`:

```bash
kubectl get deploy,sts,ds,cronjob,job,pod -A -o json > workloads.json
evergreen inventory workloads.json
```

Every importer reads one export file and produces items. The output is deterministic: results sort by file and pointer. An affected item means a lifecycle rule applies to the version the export names; `no-data` means Evergreen has no rule for that PURL, never that the thing is safe. A file no importer recognizes is listed, the run exits `2`, and the files that were recognized are still reported.

## Privacy

`inventory` reads only the files named on the command line. It makes no network request, runs no command, and reads no other file. It never executes code or tools from the scanned export. Output names only the resource's own short name: `resource` is never an account id, ARN, subscription id, project number, IP address, node name, tag, or environment variable. `--redact` replaces each resource name with the first 12 hex characters of its SHA-256, in text and JSON output alike.

## Kubernetes workloads

### What it reads

Export a cluster's workload objects:

```bash
kubectl get deploy,sts,ds,cronjob,job,pod -A -o json > workloads.json
evergreen inventory workloads.json
```

The importer recognizes a Kubernetes `List` whose items each have `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata`. A list of `Node` objects is left to the cluster importer. For every item it reads:

- `apiVersion` and `kind`, mapped to the Kubernetes lifecycle rules.
- `metadata.namespace` and `metadata.name`, which form `resource` as `<namespace>/<kind>/<name>`. Cluster-scoped objects have no namespace and use `cluster` instead.
- For `Pod`, `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `DaemonSet`, `ReplicaSet`, `Job`, and `CronJob`, every `containers[].image` and `initContainers[].image` in the pod template. For a `CronJob` that is `spec.jobTemplate.spec.template`.

Images are parsed with the same parser as the container detector. Identical image references are reported once per namespace and workload, at the first pointer where they appear. A label, annotation, environment variable, pod status, and `spec.nodeName` are never read.

### Rules matched

| Item | PURL | Registry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Container image | `pkg:docker/<repository>`, for example `pkg:docker/library/node` | `registry/container.json` |
| API version | `pkg:generic/kubernetes/<group>/<Kind>`, for example `pkg:generic/kubernetes/networking.k8s.io/Ingress` | `registry/kubernetes.json` |

A Docker Hub image is written without the registry: `docker.io/library/node` is `pkg:docker/library/node`. Images from other registries are skipped, not reported, because no rule covers them yet and a private registry host can carry an account id.

An image tag is used as the version only when it is a plain release number: `node:18.19.0` is `18.19.0`, and `node:18` is `18.0.0`. Floating tags such as `latest`, `22-alpine`, or a digest with no tag name no version, so the item is reported as `version-dependent`, not guessed. An API version is translated to the rule's semver form by the same rule as the Kubernetes detector (decision 0008): `v1` is `1.0.0`, `v1beta1` is `1.0.0-beta.1`, and `v2beta2` is `2.0.0-beta.2`.

### Limit: the API server's preferred version

`kubectl get -o json` reports each object at a version the API server chooses to serve, not necessarily the version it was stored or applied at. An object created through a removed API can therefore appear at its replacement: an `Ingress` applied as `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` is reported by a modern server as `networking.k8s.io/v1`. This importer can only judge the version the export names; it cannot infer an older stored version. Use a manifest scan to judge what the repository declares.

### What it does not judge

- Images from registries other than Docker Hub, including private registries and IP-address hosts: no rule covers them yet, so they are skipped rather than reported and no host, address, or account id reaches the output.
- Floating tags and digest-only references, whose release line the file does not name.
- The core API group (`apiVersion: v1`, such as `Pod`), which has no removed kinds in the Kubernetes migration guide.
- Objects and fields beyond the ones listed above.

The fixtures under `tests/fixtures/inventory/k8s-workloads/` reproduce the documented output shape of `kubectl get … -o json` (kubectl 1.31), with every identifier replaced by a placeholder. They were assembled from the command's output shape, not captured from a live cluster.

## Host operating systems

The `os-release` importer reads an `/etc/os-release` file from one host, or a bundle collected from several hosts, and reports the distribution release against its lifecycle rules.

### Export

One host:

```bash
ssh web-1 'cat /etc/os-release' > web-1.os-release
evergreen inventory web-1.os-release
```

Several hosts, in one file. Each block starts with `### host: <name>`; that name becomes the result's `resource`:

```bash
while read -r host; do
  printf '### host: %s\n' "$host"
  ssh "$host" 'cat /etc/os-release'
done < hosts.txt > os-release.bundle
evergreen inventory os-release.bundle
```

Evergreen runs neither loop; you run it, and Evergreen reads the result.

### Fields read

| Field | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `ID` | Names the distribution, and so the `pkg:generic/<distro>` rule set. |
| `VERSION_ID` | The release line the rules judge. The result's `pointer` is the `line:<n>` of this line in the file. |
| `ID_LIKE` | Read as the declared family. It is never used to apply a parent distribution's dates, because a derivative keeps its own release schedule. |

A block without both `ID` and a numeric `VERSION_ID` is skipped: a codename or a rolling tag such as `testing` does not name a release line the rules can judge. A single file with no host header uses its file name as the resource. Quoted values, such as `VERSION_ID="20.04"` and `ID='ubuntu'`, are read the same as unquoted ones.

### Rules matched

| Distribution (`ID`) | PURL | Release lines reported | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ubuntu` | `pkg:generic/ubuntu` | before 22.04 | `container.host-ubuntu.eol-22.04-and-older` |
| `debian` | `pkg:generic/debian` | before 12 | `container.host-debian.eol-11-and-older` |
| `rhel` | `pkg:generic/rhel` | 7 and older | `container.host-rhel.eol-7-and-older` |
| `centos` | `pkg:generic/centos` | 8 and older | `container.host-centos.eol-8-and-older` |
| `amzn` | `pkg:generic/amzn` | 2 and the 2018.03 AMI | `container.host-amazon-linux.eol-2-and-older` |
| `alpine` | `pkg:generic/alpine` | before 3.21 | `container.host-alpine.eol-3.20-and-older` |
| `sles` | `pkg:generic/sles` | 15 SP6 and older | `container.host-sles.eol-15-sp6-and-older` |

Every rule cites the distribution's own lifecycle page, not an aggregator. The rules live in `registry/container.json` next to the image rules, but use `pkg:generic/<distro>` PURLs and distribution sources: an image rule describes what a Docker tag ships, which is not the same question as what a host runs.

### What is not judged

- A file without `VERSION_ID` is skipped: a codename alone does not identify the release line for every distribution.
- A derivative reported under its own `ID` is checked only if that `ID` has a rule. `ID_LIKE` does not borrow the parent's dates. It is reported as `no-data`, not as safe.
- Paid add-on support is not treated as standard support. RHEL 7 Extended Life Cycle Support and SUSE Long Term Service Pack Support extend security fixes for a fee; the rules report that general support ended and name the add-on in the summary.
- A host with no readable `/etc/os-release` is not reported. Evergreen does not guess a distribution from other files.

### Fixtures

The fixtures under `tests/fixtures/inventory/os-release/` are the output of `cat /etc/os-release` on each distribution, with every identifier replaced by a placeholder. There is no CLI version to record: `cat` is part of the coreutils of each distribution.

## Docker containers and images

Produce the exports with the Docker CLI. Both forms are supported:

```bash
# running and stopped containers, including labels and state
docker inspect $(docker ps -aq) > docker-inspect.json

# a Compose project: a JSON array, or one JSON object per line
docker compose ps --format json > docker-compose-ps.json
```

The fixtures under [`tests/fixtures/inventory/docker/`](../tests/fixtures/inventory/docker/) follow the output of Docker CLI 29.6.2 (`docker inspect`) and Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose ps --format json`), with ids, names, and image tags replaced. The example [`examples/inventory/docker-inspect.json`](../examples/inventory/docker-inspect.json) is the same shape.

### What is read

| Format | Fields | Pointer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker inspect` | `Name`, `Config.Image` | `/i/Name`, `/i/Config/Image` |
| `docker inspect` | `Config.Labels["org.opencontainers.image.base.name"]` | `/i/Config/Labels/org.opencontainers.image.base.name` |
| `docker inspect` | `Config.Labels["org.opencontainers.image.version"]` | `/i/Config/Labels/org.opencontainers.image.version` |
| `docker compose ps` | `Service`, `Image` | `/i/Service`, `/i/Image` |

`i` is the entry's index in the JSON array, or the zero-based line for line-delimited Compose output. Nothing else is read: `Env`, `Mounts`, `NetworkSettings`, `Ports`, and `Labels` beyond the two OCI labels above never appear in the report.

`resource` is the container name without the leading `/`, or the Compose service name. The image reference is parsed with the same parser the container detector uses ([`src/detectors/container/parse-image.ts`](../src/detectors/container/parse-image.ts)); interpolated values (`${IMAGE}`) and invalid references are skipped, never guessed.

### Rules matched

Images map to Docker PURLs, `pkg:docker/<repository>`, and are checked against [`registry/container.json`](../registry/container.json). For example, `node:18-alpine` becomes `pkg:docker/library/node` at version `18-alpine`, and `redis:6.0` becomes `pkg:docker/library/redis` at `6.0`. A tag that names a release line is the version; a floating tag such as `latest` or a digest-only reference has no version, so a range rule reports `version-dependent` instead of guessing.

Images from a registry other than Docker Hub keep the registry as the PURL namespace, for example `pkg:docker/ghcr.io/acme/app`. No Docker Hub rule matches those PURLs, so they are reported as `no-data`.

The two OCI labels add items when present: `org.opencontainers.image.base.name` is the base image, and `org.opencontainers.image.version` is the image's own version. Both are checked against the same rules, with the container name as their resource.

### Image ids

When `Config.Image` is a bare image id (`sha256:…`), Evergreen does not resolve it to an image. The container is reported with the PURL `pkg:docker/image-id` and the id as its version, which yields `no-data`: there is no lifecycle rule for an unresolved id. Run `docker inspect --format '{{.Config.Image}}' <container>` with a name instead when you need the image.

### What is not judged

- The operating system and runtimes *inside* an image: export or unpack the root filesystem and run `evergreen scan` on it.
- Images on registries other than Docker Hub, and Microsoft .NET images on `mcr.microsoft.com`: no rule is applied.
- Environment variables, mounts, published ports, and network settings: never read or reported.
- Whether a container is running: stopped containers are reported the same way.

## Report shape

The JSON report is `evergreen.inventory.v1`, validated by [`schemas/inventory.v1.schema.json`](../schemas/inventory.v1.schema.json). `results` holds one entry per item and check; `unrecognized` lists the files no importer recognized. Items are sorted by file and pointer, so the same exports produce the same report.

A Package URL with no rule is reported as `no-data`; when a PURL has rules but none covers the version, the item is `not-affected`. Neither status is a statement that the version is safe. A rule for an announced date that has not happened yet is a `scheduled-end-of-life` finding at low severity, so it does not fail a `high` gate.

## Importers

| Importer | Reads | Export command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws-rds` | AWS RDS instances, Aurora clusters, and ElastiCache cache clusters | `aws rds describe-db-instances`, `aws rds describe-db-clusters`, `aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters` |

## AWS RDS, Aurora, and ElastiCache

### Produce the export

Use the AWS CLI with JSON output and pass the file to `evergreen inventory`:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --output json > rds-instances.json
aws rds describe-db-clusters --output json > rds-clusters.json
aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --output json > cache-clusters.json

evergreen inventory rds-instances.json rds-clusters.json cache-clusters.json
```

The fixtures under `tests/fixtures/inventory/aws-rds/` are sanitized samples of these three documents: every account id, ARN, endpoint, and subnet id is a placeholder, and only the fields below are kept. They were assembled from the published output shape of `aws-cli` during review rather than captured from a live account.

### Fields read

| Document | Array | Engine field | Version field | Resource field |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `describe-db-instances` | `DBInstances` | `Engine` | `EngineVersion` | `DBInstanceIdentifier` |
| `describe-db-clusters` | `DBClusters` | `Engine` | `EngineVersion` | `DBClusterIdentifier` |
| `describe-cache-clusters` | `CacheClusters` | `Engine` | `EngineVersion` | `CacheClusterId` |

Everything else in the document is ignored: ARNs, endpoints, reader endpoints, hosted zone ids, subnet groups, VPC ids, security groups, tags, and parameter groups. An entry without a string `Engine`, `EngineVersion`, and resource field is skipped, never guessed.

### Engines and PURLs

| AWS engine | Provider PURL | Upstream PURL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postgres` | `pkg:generic/aws-rds/postgres` | `pkg:generic/postgresql` |
| `mysql` | `pkg:generic/aws-rds/mysql` | `pkg:generic/mysql` |
| `aurora-postgresql` | `pkg:generic/aws-aurora/postgresql` | `pkg:generic/postgresql` |
| `aurora-mysql`, `aurora` | `pkg:generic/aws-aurora/mysql` | none (see below) |
| `redis` | `pkg:generic/aws-elasticache/redis` | `pkg:generic/redis` |

Each recognized object produces two items when the version is also an upstream version, so the report shows both the provider's schedule and the upstream engine's schedule. AWS standard support and extended support dates differ from upstream end of life, and the rules are kept separate for that reason.

Aurora MySQL is the exception: its `EngineVersion` embeds the Aurora version, as in `8.0.mysql_aurora.3.10.0`, which is not an upstream MySQL release. Only the Aurora item is emitted rather than comparing that string to upstream MySQL rules.

Unknown engines are skipped: `mariadb`, `sqlserver-*`, `oracle-*`, `db2-*`, `memcached`, and `valkey` have no reviewed rule in this importer yet, so they produce no item and no claim.

### Rules matched

The rules live in [`registry/database.json`](../registry/database.json) under the provider PURLs, with the AWS release calendar as their source. "End of standard support" is recorded with the registry's `end-of-support` event; an announced date that is still in the future is recorded as `scheduled-end-of-life` at low severity until it passes. The summary of each rule says whether RDS Extended Support or ElastiCache Extended Support may keep the version running for a fee.

| Service | Versions with a rule (as of 2026-10-30) |
| --- | --- |
| RDS for PostgreSQL | 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13 (ended); 14 (scheduled 2027-02-28) |
| RDS for MySQL | 5.7, 8.0 (ended) |
| Aurora PostgreSQL | 11, 12, 13 (ended); 14 (scheduled 2027-02-28) |
| Aurora MySQL | 1 (5.6), 2 (5.7) (ended) |
| ElastiCache Redis OSS | 4, 5 (ended 2026-01-31); 6 (scheduled 2027-01-31) |

A version outside these ranges is not reported as supported. When the provider PURL has rules for other versions, the item is `not-affected`: the check message says that rules exist and none covers this version. When the PURL has no rules at all, it is `no-data`. Neither status is a statement that the version is safe. This includes RDS for PostgreSQL 15 and later, RDS for MySQL 8.4 and later, Aurora PostgreSQL 15 and later, Aurora MySQL 3 and 8.4, and Redis OSS 7.x. Their announced end-of-standard-support dates are more than twelve months past the review date, so no rule is recorded yet under decision [0010](decisions/0010-scheduled-end-of-life.md); a later review adds them when the dates come within the window.

### What is not judged

The importer does not judge instance classes, storage, IOPS, parameter groups, patch levels within a supported minor version, certificate authorities, Multi-AZ or read-replica topology, backup retention, encryption, or licensing. It does not judge MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, Memcached, or Valkey. It does not verify that an export is complete or current. It does not read an AWS account, role, or region, and it cannot see an object that the export omits.

## Export files

Each section below documents one importer: the exact command that produces the export, the fields Evergreen reads, the lifecycle rules it matches, and what it does not judge. Fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/inventory/`, with every identifier replaced by a placeholder; the command and CLI version that produced them are recorded in the section.

## AWS Lambda

```bash
aws lambda list-functions --output json > lambda.json
evergreen inventory lambda.json
```

`list-functions` paginates. With pagination on, the CLI prints one JSON page after another; `evergreen` accepts the single page a one-page account prints as well as the array of pages a scripted caller collects. The fixtures under `tests/fixtures/inventory/aws-lambda/` reproduce the documented output of `aws lambda list-functions --output json` from AWS CLI v2, with every identifier replaced by a placeholder; they were not captured against a live account, so no CLI version is recorded.

**Fields read**

| Field | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `Functions[].FunctionName` | `resource` and nothing more. |
| `Functions[].Runtime` | `version`, and the runtime identifier in `pkg:generic/aws-lambda-runtime/<Runtime>`. |
| `Functions[].PackageType` | `Image` means the function runs a container image, which has no managed runtime, so it is skipped. |

Nothing else is copied: not `FunctionArn`, `Role`, environment variables, tags, account id, code, or architecture.

**Rules matched**

`registry/serverless.json`, the `pkg:generic/aws-lambda-runtime/<identifier>` PURLs. Every runtime the [AWS Lambda runtimes page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) gives a deprecation date for has a rule: a runtime the page lists under Deprecated runtimes is `end-of-life` at `high`, and a runtime the page lists as supported with a projected deprecation date is `scheduled-end-of-life` at `low` with that date as its deadline. The same rules back the Serverless detector, so one lifecycle fact reaches a declaration and a live function alike.

**Not judged**

- Container-image functions (`PackageType: "Image"`): their runtime lives in the image, not in the function's configuration. Rebuild the image from a newer base image instead.
- Runtimes AWS has not dated — today `nodejs26.x` and `python3.15`, which the page lists as public preview and not scheduled — are reported as `no-data`, which is not a statement that they are safe.
- Function versions, aliases, `$LATEST`, code, layers, architecture, and memory: none of them changes the runtime lifecycle answer.
- Functions that a different export would show: this importer reads only the file you pass, and only the functions in it.

## Google Cloud

```bash
gcloud functions list --format=json > functions.json
gcloud app versions list --format=json > app-engine-versions.json
gcloud container clusters list --format=json > gke-clusters.json
gcloud run services list --format=json > cloud-run-services.json
evergreen inventory functions.json app-engine-versions.json gke-clusters.json cloud-run-services.json
```

**Fields read**

| Export | Fields | PURL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gcloud functions list --format=json` | `name`, `runtime` (1st gen) or `buildConfig.runtime` (2nd gen) | `pkg:generic/google-cloud-functions-runtime/<runtime>` |
| `gcloud app versions list --format=json` | `name`, `runtime` | `pkg:generic/google-appengine-runtime/<runtime>` |
| `gcloud container clusters list --format=json` | `name`, `currentMasterVersion`, `currentNodeVersion` | `pkg:generic/google-gke` |
| `gcloud run services list --format=json` | `metadata.name`, `spec.template.spec.containers[].image` | `pkg:docker/library/<image>` |

`name` supplies the resource: the last path segment, never the project id or number. A Cloud Functions or App Engine runtime item reports the runtime as part of PURL, so the pointer marks the exact field the runtime was read from. A GKE cluster produces one item for the control-plane version and, when it differs, one for the node version; `releaseChannel` does not change the verdict, because the rules state both the end of standard support and the end of extended support.

Cloud Run has no managed language runtime. The importer reads only container images and only those that name a public Docker Hub base image (`node:20`, `python:3.12-slim`, or `library/node:20`): an image with a registry host or a namespace (`gcr.io/…`, `us-docker.pkg.dev/…`, `bitnami/node`) is skipped, as is an image with no tag, a digest-only reference, or a tag that does not start with a digit. A short image name maps to `pkg:docker/library/<name>` with the tag as the version.

**Rules matched**

- `registry/serverless.json`: Google Cloud Functions and App Engine runtime rules, sourced to Google's runtime support schedules.
- `registry/kubernetes.json`: GKE minor-version rules, sourced to the GKE release schedule.
- `registry/container.json`: base-image rules for Cloud Run images.

**What is not judged**

- Runtime *generations* and stack images (`google-22`, `google-24-full`); only the runtime ID is checked.
- Operating-system packages inside a function or container image.
- Image digests, private images, and image names that are not public base images.
- Anything not written literally in the export: a reference, a variable, or a value the export does not include is not resolved.

**Fixtures**

`tests/fixtures/inventory/gcp/` holds one sanitized sample per document type, and `examples/inventory/` holds two runnable samples. Each follows the JSON the commands above print, reduced to the fields this importer reads, with every project id, number, service account, URL, IP address, and environment value replaced by a placeholder. No `gcloud` CLI version is recorded because the contributor who added this importer had no Google Cloud project to capture exports from; the shapes follow the documented JSON output of the commands above rather than a recorded response.
