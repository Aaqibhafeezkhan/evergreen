## Sources

- [CMake 4.0 release notes (FindGDAL deprecated)](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/4.0.html)
- [FindGDAL module documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindGDAL.html)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Confirm the GDAL install that the project uses ships a CONFIG package before dropping FindGDAL.
- Target and variable names may differ between FindGDAL and the upstream CONFIG package; update link lines to match.

**Steps**

1. **Switch to find_package(GDAL CONFIG).** Replace find_package(GDAL) / include(FindGDAL) with find_package(GDAL CONFIG) and link the imported targets the upstream package exports.

**Verification**

- `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build`: Configure and build after the GDAL find_package change.

## Detected by

No built-in detector reads `cpp` declarations yet; the rule is data in the [lifecycle registry](https://github.com/arminazimi/evergreen/blob/main/registry/cpp.json).

## Data

This page is generated from [`registry/cpp.json`](https://github.com/arminazimi/evergreen/blob/main/registry/cpp.json), rule `cpp.cmake.module.find-gdal.deprecated`, in the `evergreen.registry.v2` format ([how rules are written](../RULES.md)). A CLE (ECMA-428) export is not published yet. The same facts are embedded in this page as schema.org structured data.
