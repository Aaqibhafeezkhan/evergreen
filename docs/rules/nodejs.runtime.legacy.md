## Sources

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep package metadata, local version files, CI matrices, and deployment runtimes on a mutually compatible Node.js release.
- Expect dependency and language compatibility changes when crossing multiple Node.js majors.

**Steps**

1. **Update the Node.js declaration.** Raise the reported engines or pinned runtime declaration to Node.js 22 LTS or later.
2. **Upgrade across supported majors.** Resolve dependency and runtime incompatibilities in supported-major increments before adopting the final target.
3. **Align runtime surfaces.** Update matching local version files, CI matrices, container images, and deployment configuration.

**Verification**

- `node --version`: Confirm the active Node.js runtime is supported.
- `npm run test --if-present`: Run the repository test suite on the target runtime when defined.
- `npm run build --if-present`: Verify the project builds on the target runtime.
