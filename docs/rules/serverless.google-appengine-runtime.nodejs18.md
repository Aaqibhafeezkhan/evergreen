# App Engine Node.js 18 runtime is past end of support

**End of support** as of 2025-04-30. Replacement: nodejs22 or nodejs24. Source: [App Engine standard environment runtime support schedule](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/lifecycle/support-schedule).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/google-appengine-runtime/nodejs18
```

The App Engine standard environment runtime support schedule lists Node.js 18 (runtime ID nodejs18) with end of support on 2025-04-30 and deprecation on 2026-04-30. Google no longer provides patches or support for that runtime.

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep the App Engine service runtime on an ID Google still supports; the service must be redeployed as a new version to change it.
- Raising the runtime can require language and dependency changes; confirm the app runs on the replacement before shifting traffic.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the App Engine runtime.** Set the runtime to a supported runtime ID (see the replacement) in app.yaml and in the Terraform google_app_engine_standard_app_version.
2. **Deploy a new version.** Deploy the change as a new version and move traffic to it after it serves correctly.

**Verification**

- `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`: Initialize without touching remote state and check that the configuration is valid.
- `terraform plan`: Review the plan and confirm the runtime change is the intended one.
