## Sources

- [goobook maintenance notice](https://pypi.org/project/goobook/)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve contact fields, address-book search, authentication, caching, and command output used by scripts.

**Steps**

1. **Select a maintained contacts client.** Choose a maintained Google Contacts or CardDAV client, export or preserve local state, and replace goobook commands and integrations.

**Verification**

- `python -m pytest`: Run contact lookup, synchronization, and repository tests when defined.
