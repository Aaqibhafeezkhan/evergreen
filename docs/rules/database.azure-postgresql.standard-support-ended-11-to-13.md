# Azure Database for PostgreSQL 11, 12, and 13 are past standard support

The Azure Database for PostgreSQL version policy lists 2026-07-31 as the standard support end date for PostgreSQL 11, 12, and 13. After that date Azure offers only time-boxed Extended Support, and it does not allow new servers on those major versions.

- [PostgreSQL versioning policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- The version argument on azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server and azurerm_postgresql_server names the major version; changing it alone does not move an existing server or its data.
- Azure applies a major version upgrade through its managed upgrade operation. Take a backup or point-in-time restore point first, and do not treat changing version back as a rollback.
- Azure Extended Support keeps the server running after the standard support end date, but it is time-boxed and does not replace moving to a supported major.

**Steps**

1. **Back up the server.** Take a verified backup or point-in-time restore point of every Azure Database for PostgreSQL server reported, before changing its major version.
2. **Upgrade the server to a supported major.** Upgrade the server to PostgreSQL 14 or later with Azure's major version upgrade, or restore the backup into a new flexible server on the replacement major and move the application connection string to it.
3. **Raise the declared version.** Change version in every azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server and azurerm_postgresql_server block that runs this database, not only the reported line.
4. **Check clients and extensions.** Update PostgreSQL drivers, ORMs, extensions, and Azure networking or identity settings that assume the old major version.

**Verification**

- `terraform validate`: Check that the Terraform configuration is valid with the new version argument.
- `terraform plan`: Review the plan and confirm the version change is intended and is the only server change.
- `az postgres flexible-server list --query "[].{name:name, version:version}"`: Confirm each reported flexible server now reports a supported PostgreSQL major version.
- `docker compose config`: Confirm any local Compose service that mirrors this database is valid and uses a PostgreSQL image tag that matches the replacement.
