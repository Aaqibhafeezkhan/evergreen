# AWS Lambda Python 3.13 runtime reaches end of life on 2029-06-30

**Scheduled end of life** as of 2029-06-30. Replacement: python3.14. Source: [AWS Lambda runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/aws-lambda-runtime/python3.13
```

The AWS Lambda runtimes table lists python3.13 as supported with a projected deprecation date of 2029-06-30. After that date AWS no longer applies security or other updates to that managed runtime.

## Sources

- [AWS Lambda runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) (accessed 2026-10-30)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep provider.runtime, Globals.Function.Runtime, per-function Runtime, and Terraform aws_lambda_function.runtime on one AWS Lambda runtime identifier that AWS still supports.
- Raising the managed runtime can require Python language and dependency changes; confirm handlers and native modules run on the replacement before deploying.
- This runtime is still supported today; the rule is a warning ahead of the announced date, so plan the move before it.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the AWS Lambda runtime.** Change the reported Runtime (or provider.runtime / terraform runtime) from python3.13 to a supported AWS Lambda Python identifier (see the replacement).
2. **Align other runtime surfaces.** Update every other SAM/CloudFormation Globals or function Runtime, serverless.yml provider or function runtime, Terraform aws_lambda_function.runtime, and CI deploy config that still pins python3.13.

**Verification**

- `sam validate || serverless print || terraform validate`: Validate the updated SAM, Serverless Framework, or Terraform declaration before deploy.
