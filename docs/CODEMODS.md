# Codemods

`evergreen fix` plans deterministic repairs for findings whose change is mechanical, and prints them as unified diffs that `git apply` accepts. It never writes a file or runs a command. A codemod applies only while the text it rewrites still matches the finding, and every finding it declines is reported as a refusal with the reason.

```bash
evergreen fix --dry-run            # print the patches
evergreen fix --branch <name>      # apply them on a local branch and re-scan
```

## Dockerfile legacy syntax

Rules `container.dockerfile.maintainer` and `container.dockerfile.legacy-env-format` are repaired by the `dockerfile-legacy` fixer.

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `MAINTAINER Evergreen Team <team@example.com>` | `LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors="Evergreen Team <team@example.com>"` |
| `ENV APP_HOME /opt/app` | `ENV APP_HOME="/opt/app"` |

The fixer leaves an instruction alone and reports why when the value contains a double quote or a backslash, when the instruction continues on another line, when the value contains a heredoc, and when the instruction sits inside an `ONBUILD` trigger. An `ENV key=value` assignment is already in the supported form and is not reported.

A worked example lives in [`examples/codemods/dockerfile-legacy`](../examples/codemods/dockerfile-legacy).
`evergreen fix` repairs some deprecations exactly, at the lines a scan reports, and prints unified diffs that `git apply` accepts. Nothing is written unless you pass `--branch`, and no codemod uses the network or runs the scanned repository's code. A codemod rewrites a finding only when the replacement behaves identically for every input the matched shape accepts; anything else is left unchanged and listed as a refusal in `fix --json`.
## node-renames
Rewrites the Node.js deprecations that are pure renames: the old name calls the same implementation. Only the member name changes; the receiver expression and the arguments are kept byte-for-byte.
| Rule | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `nodejs.symbol.os.tmpdir` | `os.tmpDir()` | `os.tmpdir()` |
| `nodejs.symbol.path.makelong` | `path._makeLong(p)` | `path.toNamespacedPath(p)` |
| `nodejs.symbol.async-hooks.currentid` | `async_hooks.currentId()` | `async_hooks.executionAsyncId()` |
| `nodejs.symbol.async-hooks.triggerid` | `async_hooks.triggerId()` | `async_hooks.triggerAsyncId()` |
| `nodejs.symbol.crypto.hash` | `crypto.Hash(algorithm)` called without `new` | `crypto.createHash(algorithm)` |
| `nodejs.symbol.crypto.hmac` | `crypto.Hmac(algorithm, key)` called without `new` | `crypto.createHmac(algorithm, key)` |
Each equivalence is read from the Node.js source: [`tmpDir` is `deprecate(tmpdir, …)`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v13.14.0/lib/os.js#L298), [`_makeLong` is assigned `toNamespacedPath` on both platforms](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.23.0/lib/path.js#L1725-L1726), [`currentId` and `triggerId` are renamed to the same functions](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v8.1.4/lib/async_hooks.js#L183-L193), and [`Hash`/`Hmac` called without `new` construct the same object `createHash`/`createHmac` return](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.23.0/lib/internal/crypto/hash.js#L88-L163).
Two candidates are not covered because they are not exact aliases. `os.getNetworkInterfaces()` returns the native flat array while `os.networkInterfaces()` builds the keyed object, and `module.createRequire()` validates its argument and decodes non-absolute strings as file URLs while `module.createRequireFromPath()` accepts any path.
Refused, with the reason in `fix --json`:
- a call through a local binding, such as a destructured or aliased import (`const { tmpDir } = require("os"); tmpDir()`);
- an optional call (`os.tmpDir?.()` or `os?.tmpDir()`);
- a computed member access (`os["tmpDir"]()`);
- a constructor call such as `new crypto.Hash(...)`, which is not the call form the rename covers;
`evergreen fix` prints deterministic patches for findings whose repair is purely syntactic. It never writes a file, never runs a command, and never uses the network; the output is a unified diff that `git apply` accepts.
evergreen scan .
evergreen fix . | git apply --check
evergreen fix . | git apply
A fixer rewrites only the exact form its rule names. A finding it cannot repair without guessing is left in place and reported as a refusal with the reason, so a patch never hides a change the tool did not understand.
## Terraform legacy syntax
Two Terraform language forms have a one-to-one rewrite:
| Finding | Rewrite |
| `terraform.syntax.interpolation-only` | `"${var.name}"` becomes `var.name` |
| `terraform.function.list-map` | `list(a, b)` becomes `tolist([a, b])`; `map(k, v)` becomes `tomap({ k = v })` |
Interpolation-only strings were deprecated in Terraform v0.12.14. Terraform still accepts them, but recommends the bare expression. The `list()` and `map()` functions were removed in Terraform v0.15, so a configuration that still calls them fails to validate on 0.15 and later.
evergreen scan . --only terraform
evergreen fix . | git apply
terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate
terraform plan
### What is detected
- A quoted string whose entire value is one `${ ... }` interpolation, in a value, object key, or block label.
- A value call to `list()` or `map()`, including one inside an interpolation expression.
A string with any literal text around the interpolation, such as `"prefix-${var.name}"`, is not interpolation-only and is not reported. Neither are heredocs, comments, plain string contents, `%{ ... }` directives, escaped strings, or the `list(string)` and `map(object({...}))` type constraints, which remain valid.
### What is rewritten
- An interpolation-only string in a value position loses its quotes. A string used as an object key or a block label is refused: removing its quotes would change the key syntax or produce invalid HCL.
- A `list()` or `map()` call is rewritten only when every argument is on one line and the argument count is valid. `list()` needs at least one argument, `map()` needs an even number of key/value arguments, and each key must be an identifier or a quoted string.
- A call whose arguments span lines, an empty `list()`, an odd `map()` argument count, or an expression map key is refused with the reason rather than guessed.
- Files under `.terraform/`, files whose header says another tool generates them, and files without a trailing newline are refused. Finding a file already in its rewritten form leaves nothing for a second pass.
The `examples/codemods/terraform-legacy` directory contains a before and after pair. The detector and codemod use bounded, pure parsing only; Terraform is never run.
## python-imp
Rewrites the `imp` calls that have exact `importlib`, `types`, or `sys` equivalents, so the code runs on Python 3.12, where `imp` was [removed](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#removed).
| Rule | Before | After | Import added |
|---|---|---|---|
| `python.symbol.imp.reload` | `imp.reload(m)` | `importlib.reload(m)` | `import importlib` |
| `python.symbol.imp.new-module` | `imp.new_module(n)` | `types.ModuleType(n)` | `import types` |
| `python.symbol.imp.get-magic` | `imp.get_magic()` | `importlib.util.MAGIC_NUMBER` | `import importlib.util` |
| `python.symbol.imp.get-tag` | `imp.get_tag()` | `sys.implementation.cache_tag` | `import sys` |
| `python.symbol.imp.cache-from-source` | `imp.cache_from_source(p)` | `importlib.util.cache_from_source(p)` | `import importlib.util` |
| `python.symbol.imp.source-from-cache` | `imp.source_from_cache(p)` | `importlib.util.source_from_cache(p)` | `import importlib.util` |
Each equivalence is documented by the standard library: [`importlib.reload`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload), [`types.ModuleType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType), [`importlib.util.MAGIC_NUMBER`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.MAGIC_NUMBER), [`sys.implementation.cache_tag`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.implementation), [`importlib.util.cache_from_source`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.cache_from_source), and [`importlib.util.source_from_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.source_from_cache).
Each needed import is added on the line after `import imp` when it is not already present. When every `imp.` use in the file was rewritten, the `import imp` line is replaced by the added imports, because `import imp` itself fails on Python 3.12. When any use remains, `import imp` stays and the new imports are inserted after it.
```python
import imp
module = imp.reload(existing)
magic = imp.get_magic()
becomes
```python
import importlib
import importlib.util
module = importlib.reload(existing)
magic = importlib.util.MAGIC_NUMBER
- `imp.find_module`, `imp.load_module`, `imp.load_source`, and `imp.get_suffixes`, which have no exact equivalent;
- a keyword argument the replacement does not accept, such as `imp.reload(m, file=...)`;
- a second positional argument to `imp.cache_from_source`, where it means `debug_override` in `imp` but `optimization` in `importlib.util`;
- any argument to `imp.get_magic` or `imp.get_tag`, whose replacement is a constant;
- a splat argument, whose names are not visible in the source text;
- a call written through a rebinding, such as `reload = imp.reload; reload(m)`;
- `from imp import ...`, `import imp as ...`, an `import imp` statement that also imports other modules, more than one `import imp`, or one that shares its line with other code;
- a file that cannot be read, has syntax errors, or does not end with a newline.
## node-buffer
Rewrites the deprecated Node.js `Buffer` constructor (`nodejs.symbol.buffer.constructor`, DEP0005) and `SlowBuffer` (`nodejs.symbol.slowbuffer`, DEP0030) when the argument's kind is visible in the source text.
|---|---|
| `new Buffer(<number literal>)` / `Buffer(<number literal>)` | `Buffer.alloc(<number>)` |
| `new Buffer(<string or template literal>[, <string literal encoding>])` | `Buffer.from(<string>[, <encoding>])` |
| `new Buffer(<array literal>)` | `Buffer.from(<array>)` |
| `new SlowBuffer(<number literal>)` | `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(<number>)` |
`Buffer.alloc` zero-fills the new buffer. The `Buffer` constructor has zero-filled its numeric form since Node.js 8, so the rewrite keeps the old behavior; Node.js documents the deprecation as [DEP0005](https://nodejs.org/api/deprecations.html#dep0005-buffer-constructor-deprecation).
- an identifier, call, member expression, binary expression, spread, or any other argument whose kind is not a number, string, template without substitutions, or array literal;
- `new Buffer(buffer, offset, length)` and any argument count the table does not list;
- an argument wrapped in a TypeScript type assertion (`as`, `satisfies`, `<T>x`, `!`);
- a template literal with substitutions;
- a `SlowBuffer` call without `new`, or a member-expression form such as `buffer.SlowBuffer(...)`;
- a file that cannot be read, does not end with a newline, or does not parse.
