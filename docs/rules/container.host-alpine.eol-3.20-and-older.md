## Sources

- [Alpine Linux releases](https://alpinelinux.org/releases/)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Upgrade one Alpine branch at a time and reinstall packages from the target repositories.
- Confirm services and pinned packages have builds for the target branch.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade the Alpine host.** Move the host to a supported Alpine branch with the documented upgrade procedure, or rebuild it and redeploy the workload.

**Verification**

- `cat /etc/alpine-release`: Confirm the host reports the target Alpine branch.
- `apk update`: Check that the target repositories are reachable and current.
