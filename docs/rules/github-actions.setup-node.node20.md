## Sources

- [Node 20 is no longer available in GitHub Actions](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-09-23-node-20-is-no-longer-available-in-github-actions/)
- [actions/setup-node v5 runtime guidance](https://github.com/actions/setup-node#breaking-changes-in-v5)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve the selected Node.js version, registry authentication, and dependency-cache behavior.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade setup-node.** Change the uses reference to actions/setup-node@v5 or a later supported major.
2. **Review runtime and cache inputs.** Confirm node-version, registry-url, cache, and cache-dependency-path remain valid for the target release.

**Verification**

- `git diff --check`: Validate the edited workflow diff.
