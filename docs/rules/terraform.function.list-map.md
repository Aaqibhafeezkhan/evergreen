# The list() and map() functions were removed in Terraform 0.15

**Removed.** The source gives no day. Replacement: tolist([ ... ]) for list(), tomap({ ... }) for map(). Source: [Terraform 0.15 upgrade guide: legacy configuration language features](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/upgrade-guides/0-15).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/terraform
```

Terraform v0.12 replaced the list() and map() functions with first-class [ ... ] and { ... } syntax, and the v0.15 upgrade guide states that the deprecated functions were removed in v0.15. Replace list(a, b) with tolist([a, b]) and map(k, v) with tomap({ k = v }); because Terraform can usually infer the type from context, the bare [ ... ] and { ... } forms often work without the conversion. The list(string) and map(string) type constraints are different and remain valid.

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Do not rewrite a type constraint: `type = list(string)` and `type = map(object({...}))` are type constructors that still exist in Terraform 0.15 and later.
- Rewrite a call only when every argument is on one line and the argument count is meaningful: list() needs at least one value, and map() needs an even number of key/value arguments.
- In a map() call, write each key as an identifier or a quoted string; a bare expression key does not have the same meaning in an object constructor.

**Steps**

1. **Replace the removed calls.** Change `list(a, b)` to `tolist([a, b])` and `map("k", v)` to `tomap({ k = v })`. When the surrounding context already fixes the type, the bare `[a, b]` and `{ k = v }` forms are also correct.
2. **Find the calls left in other files.** Search *.tf for `list(` and `map(` outside variable type constraints, and rewrite the value calls the same way. Leave `list(string)`, `map(string)`, and other type constructors unchanged.

**Verification**

- `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`: Initialize without touching remote state and check that no removed function is left.
- `terraform plan`: Confirm the collection types and values are unchanged apart from the rewrite.
