## Sources

- [jade package deprecation notice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jade)
- [jade registry metadata](https://registry.npmjs.org/jade/latest)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve template rendering, locals, includes, inheritance, whitespace, and generated HTML.

**Steps**

1. **Replace Jade with Pug.** Replace the jade dependency, imports, file extensions, and build integrations with pug equivalents.
2. **Compare rendered output.** Render representative templates and review generated HTML and escaping behavior for differences.

**Verification**

- `npm run test --if-present`: Run template rendering and repository tests when defined.
