## Sources

- [are-we-there-yet registry metadata](https://registry.npmjs.org/are-we-there-yet/latest)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve weighted completion, nested tracker groups, stream progress, event timing, and completion semantics.

**Steps**

1. **Replace progress tracking.** Select a maintained progress tracker or implement the required aggregation locally, migrate tracker construction and updates, then remove the package.

**Verification**

- `npm run test --if-present`: Run nested progress, completion, event, and repository tests.
