## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve the Terraform version, CLI configuration credentials, and wrapper setting when upgrading.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade setup-terraform.** Change the uses reference to hashicorp/setup-terraform@v4 or a later supported major.
2. **Review setup-terraform inputs.** Compare configured inputs with the target release and update renamed or changed options; confirm the runner meets the release's minimum version.

**Verification**

- `git diff --check`: Validate the edited workflow diff.
