## Sources

- [Node Sass is end-of-life](https://sass-lang.com/blog/node-sass-is-end-of-life/)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve Sass include paths, importer behavior, output style, source maps, and generated CSS expected by the build.

**Steps**

1. **Replace Node Sass.** Remove node-sass and add the maintained sass package in the same dependency section.
2. **Update compiler usages.** Migrate render and renderSync imports and options to the supported Sass interface used by the project.
3. **Compare compiled output.** Review generated CSS and source maps for behaviorally relevant differences.

**Verification**

- `npm run test --if-present`: Run stylesheet and repository tests when defined.
- `npm run build --if-present`: Compile the project and its stylesheets with Sass.
