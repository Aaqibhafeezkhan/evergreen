# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add end-of-life rules for every unsupported Django release series from 1.3 through 5.1 (`python.package.django-<series>.eol`), with the dates from the Django supported-versions page. A bounded Python package rule now matches a lockfile entry or an exact `==` pin, not a declared range, so a `Django>=3.2` requirement alone produces no Django finding. Supported series (5.2 LTS, 6.0, 6.1) have no rule until the page gives their end dates to the day.
- Add the iOS 13 App Store upload rule (`swift.app-store.ios-below-13`). The Swift detector reads `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` from application targets in `project.pbxproj` only, so libraries that declare an older `platforms:` minimum are not reported. (#808)
- Promote the .NET detector to beta (decision 0013). The corpus has twelve blind-selected .NET repositories on top
  of the six targeted ones (84 expected `dotnet` findings, precision 1 and recall 1 on the full run), and corpus
  entries gain an optional `selection` field that the maturity test counts.
- Add end-of-support rules for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 3.0, and deprecation rules for the NuGet
  packages `Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB`, `Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus`, and `Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob`.
  Repositories that target these lines now get findings where they had none.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-18

- Add four detectors, all experimental (decision 0013): Java and Kotlin (out-of-support JDK pins and moved Maven
  dependencies), Kubernetes (removed API versions in manifests, Helm charts, and kustomize), Rust (unsupported
  toolchains and abandoned crates, with the files that use them), and .NET (unsupported SDKs and target frameworks,
  and deprecated NuGet packages, with the C# files that use them).
- Add optional `owner`, `reason`, `created`, and `expires` to baseline suppressions. A suppression that is about to
  expire is reported, and one that has expired stops hiding its finding, or fails the job with `--on-expired fail`.
- Add the `scheduled-end-of-life` event for an announced end of life that has not happened yet, at low severity, with
  the announced date. The first rules are .NET 8 and 9 (2026-11-10).
- Add `maturity` (experimental, beta, or stable) to each ecosystem in the capability manifest, now version 1.1.0, and
  define the three levels and the evidence each needs.
- The GitHub Action explains which policy gate failed, how many findings caused it, and where the report is; its inputs
  and outputs are documented and kept in step with `action.yml` by a test. The major Action tag will move
  automatically from the first stable v1.0.0.
- Lifecycle data published after this release requires Evergreen 0.3.0 or newer, because it can contain scheduled
  end-of-life rules.
- Known limits: the Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and Kilo Code setups under `examples/agents/` have not been run
  inside the hosts themselves (the server command was checked against the published package).
