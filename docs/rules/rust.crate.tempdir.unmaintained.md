## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep temporary directories cleaned up on drop, as before.

**Steps**

1. **Replace tempdir with tempfile.** Replace the tempdir dependency with tempfile and change `TempDir::new(prefix)` calls to `tempfile::tempdir()` or `tempfile::Builder`.

**Verification**

- `cargo build --all-targets && cargo test`: Build and run the tests that create temporary directories.
