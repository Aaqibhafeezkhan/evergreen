## Sources

- [sbt download — release timeline](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download/)
- [Migrating from sbt 0.13.x](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Migrating-from-sbt-013x.html)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep project/build.properties sbt.version, the installed sbt launcher, and CI sbt setup on one supported sbt major.
- Migrate build definitions away from 0.13-only syntax before raising sbt.version; see the migration guide.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the sbt version.** Change project/build.properties sbt.version from 0.13.x to a supported release (see the replacement).
2. **Migrate the build definition.** Apply the sbt 0.13 → 1.x migration guide for operators, Build.scala layouts, and plugins, then re-resolve plugins.

**Verification**

- `sbt -Dsbt.supershell=false sbtVersion`: Confirm the active sbt version is the intended release.
- `sbt -Dsbt.supershell=false compile`: Compile the project on the new sbt.
- `sbt -Dsbt.supershell=false test`: Run the sbt test suite on the new sbt.
