## Sources

- [analysis_server_client package metadata](https://pub.dev/api/packages/analysis_server_client)
- [Hosted Pub Repository Specification Version 2](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/repository-spec-v2.md)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- analysis_server_client wraps the analysis_server protocol, so replacing it changes the call sites and not only the dependency entry: migrate the pubspec declaration and the Dart code that imports the package together.
- The publisher lists no replacement package on pub.dev, so choose a maintained fork or a direct implementation of the protocol before removing the dependency.

**Steps**

1. **Audit the client call sites.** List every file that imports package:analysis_server_client and the client, server, and protocol calls it makes.
2. **Choose a maintained replacement.** Pick a maintained fork or implement the analysis_server protocol directly, and confirm the choice supports the Dart SDK constraint in environment.sdk.
3. **Replace the dependency.** Update the imports and call sites, replace analysis_server_client in pubspec.yaml, and re-resolve dependencies so pubspec.lock no longer contains it.

**Verification**

- `dart pub get`: Re-resolve dependencies after replacing the package.
- `dart analyze && dart test`: Analyze and test a Dart package on the replacement client.
- `dart analyze && flutter test`: Analyze and test a Flutter app on the replacement client.
