# @angular/core v21 reaches end of life on 2027-06-30

**Scheduled end of life** as of 2027-06-30. Replacement: @angular/core@22. Source: [Angular release and support schedule](https://angular.dev/reference/releases).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:npm/%40angular/core
```

Angular's release schedule lists v21 with "LTS ends 2027-06", a month-precision date. Evergreen uses the last day of that month, 2027-06-30, as the deadline. LTS receives only critical fixes and security patches until the end of that month.

## Sources

- [Angular release and support schedule](https://angular.dev/reference/releases)
- [Angular Update Guide](https://angular.dev/update-guide)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Update one major at a time. Each target major must be supported when you run ng update.
- Keep @angular/core, @angular/cli, and every other @angular/* package on the same major.

**Steps**

1. **Update to Angular v22.** Run `ng update @angular/core@22 @angular/cli@22`, then apply the v22 steps in the Angular Update Guide, including the required TypeScript and Node.js versions.
2. **Review changed Angular APIs.** Check each reported @angular/core import against the Angular Update Guide for removed, renamed, or changed APIs.

**Verification**

- `npm ls @angular/core`: Confirm that @angular/core resolves to the target major.
- `npm run build --if-present`: Build the application on the target major.
- `npm run test --if-present`: Run the unit tests when the project defines them.
