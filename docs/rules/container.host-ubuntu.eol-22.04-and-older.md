## Sources

- [Ubuntu release cycle](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Upgrade one release at a time, or rebuild the host on the target LTS and redeploy the workload.
- Extended Security Maintenance is a separate paid subscription; do not count it as standard support.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade the Ubuntu host.** Move the host to a supported Ubuntu LTS, confirm pinned packages and services, then drain and return it to service.

**Verification**

- `lsb_release -a`: Confirm the host reports the target Ubuntu release.
- `apt-get -s upgrade`: Check that package upgrades resolve on the target release.
