## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve the app identifier, private key input, owner and repository scoping, and requested permissions when upgrading.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade create-github-app-token.** Change the uses reference to actions/create-github-app-token@v3 or a later supported major.
2. **Review create-github-app-token inputs.** Compare configured inputs with the target release and update renamed or changed options; confirm the runner meets the release's minimum version.

**Verification**

- `git diff --check`: Validate the edited workflow diff.
