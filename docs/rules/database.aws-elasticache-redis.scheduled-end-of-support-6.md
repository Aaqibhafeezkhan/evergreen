- [ElastiCache Extended Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/extended-support.html)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- An ElastiCache engine upgrade is an in-place modification; the cache is unavailable while nodes are replaced, and restoring a cluster-mode-disabled cache over a newer engine is not a rollback.
- Take a manual backup before the change and verify that it can be restored.
- Extended Support keeps the cache running past the end of standard support for a fee; it does not replace moving to Valkey or Redis OSS 7.1 or later.

**Steps**

1. **Take a backup.** Take a manual ElastiCache backup of every reported cluster and verify that it can be restored.
2. **Upgrade the engine.** Modify the cache cluster or replication group to a supported engine version, or create a new cache on Valkey or Redis OSS 7.1 or later and move clients to it.
3. **Raise the declared version.** Change engine_version in every aws_elasticache_cluster and aws_elasticache_replication_group block, Compose service, and Helm value that runs this cache.
4. **Check clients and parameter groups.** Update Redis clients, connection strings, and parameter groups that assume the old engine version.

**Verification**

- `terraform plan`: Review the plan and confirm the engine_version change is intended and is the only cache change.
- `docker compose config`: Confirm any local Compose service that mirrors this cache is valid and uses an image tag that matches Valkey or Redis OSS 7.1 or later.
- `aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --query "CacheClusters[?Engine=='redis'].[CacheClusterId,EngineVersion]" --output table`: Confirm each reported cache cluster now reports a supported Redis OSS engine version.
