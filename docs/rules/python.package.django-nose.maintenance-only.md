## Sources

- [django-nose project notice](https://pypi.org/project/django-nose/)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve Django settings selection, database setup, fixture loading, test labels, and any django-nose plugin behavior.

**Steps**

1. **Choose the Django test runner.** Select pytest-django or Django's built-in test runner and document the chosen invocation.
2. **Migrate runner configuration.** Replace TEST_RUNNER, imports, plugins, and django-nose-specific options at every reported usage.
3. **Replace the dependency.** Remove django-nose and add only the target runner and plugins required by the suite.

**Verification**

- `python manage.py test`: Run Django's configured test suite.
- `python -m pytest`: Run the suite through pytest-django when selected.
- `python -m pip check`: Check installed dependency compatibility.
