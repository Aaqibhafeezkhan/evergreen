## Migration

**Constraints**

- Preserve the behavior the application depends on, and check each Vue 2 behavior listed in the Vue 3 breaking changes against the reported files.
- Keep a single Vue runtime in the build: when the project uses vue-template-compiler, replace it with @vue/compiler-sfc.

**Steps**

1. **Choose the upgrade path.** Upgrade straight to Vue 3, or install @vue/compat at the same version as vue and alias vue to it to run Vue 2 compatible behavior first. vue-cli projects can run vue upgrade to update @vue/cli-service.
2. **Update the Vue dependencies.** Set vue to a 3.x version in dependencies, and replace vue-template-compiler with @vue/compiler-sfc in devDependencies when present. Custom webpack setups upgrade vue-loader to ^16.0.0.
3. **Replace the Vue 2 global API.** At each reported import, replace new Vue() root instances with createApp() and move global configuration onto the application instance.
4. **Clear migration build warnings.** Build and run the application, fix each compatibility warning until none remain, then remove @vue/compat and switch the compiler to Vue 3 mode.

**Verification**

- `npm ls vue`: Confirm that one Vue 3 release resolves and no Vue 2 copy remains.
- `npm run build --if-present`: Compile the application and surface any remaining compiler warnings.
- `npm test --if-present`: Run the repository tests when defined.
