# Spring Boot 1.x is out of open-source support

**End of support.** The source gives no day. Replacement: Spring Boot 4.1.x. Source: [Spring Boot support policy](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:maven/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot
```

Spring Boot 1.x has reached the end of its open-source support lifecycle. Upgrade to a supported Spring Boot 4.x line; assess the 1.x-to-4.x migration in stages because it crosses multiple major releases. Commercial support availability is separate from community OSS support.

## Sources

## Migration

**Constraints**

- This finding describes open-source support, not whether a commercial support contract exists.
- Do not jump directly across several major versions without reviewing each intervening migration guide and compatibility requirements.

**Steps**

1. **Plan the major-version upgrade.** Inventory Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Java, build-tool, and managed dependency versions. Read each Spring Boot migration guide between the current version and the selected 4.x target.
2. **Align Spring Boot declarations.** Update the Spring Boot dependency, parent/BOM, plugin, and related build declarations consistently, then resolve and remove obsolete configuration using the migration guides.

**Verification**

- `./mvnw -B verify || ./gradlew build`: Build and run the project's tests after the staged upgrade.
- `./mvnw -B dependency:tree || ./gradlew dependencies`: Review the resolved Spring dependency graph for mixed or obsolete versions.

## Detected by

The [`java`](../detectors/java.md) detector. See [Detectors](../DETECTORS.md) and [Compatibility](../COMPATIBILITY.md).
