# Node.js image release line 22 reaches end-of-life on 2027-04-30

**Scheduled end of life** as of 2027-04-30. Replacement: A node image on a later supported release line, such as node:24. Source: [Node.js end-of-life releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/eol).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:docker/library/node
```

Node.js 22 is scheduled to stop receiving security and bug fixes on 2027-04-30, so images tagged with it will then be built on an unsupported runtime.

- [Node.js Release Working Group schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/main/schedule.json)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep the Dockerfile base image, Compose image, CI service containers, and the engines field in package.json on one supported Node.js release line.
- Confirm native modules and production dependencies support the target Node.js major.

**Steps**

1. **Update the base image.** Change the reported FROM line or Compose image to a tag on a supported release line, and pin it to a digest if your policy requires.
2. **Align other image references.** Update other Dockerfiles, Compose files, CI service containers, and deployment manifests that use the same image so they agree.

**Verification**

- `docker build .`: Build the image on the new base.
- `docker run --rm IMAGE node --version`: Confirm the container runs the intended Node.js version.
