# Google Cloud Functions Ruby 3.0 runtime is end-of-life

**End of life** as of 2025-03-31. Replacement: ruby34 or ruby40. Source: [Cloud Run functions runtime support](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/runtime-support).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/google-cloud-functions-runtime/ruby30
```

The Cloud Run functions runtime support schedule lists Ruby 3.0 (runtime ID ruby30) as deprecated on 2024-03-31 and decommissioned on 2025-03-31. Google no longer provides maintenance for that runtime.

## Sources

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep every Terraform google_cloudfunctions*_function runtime on one Google Cloud Functions runtime ID that Google still supports.
- Raising the managed runtime can require language and dependency changes; confirm handlers run on the replacement before deploying.

**Steps**

1. **Raise the Google Cloud Functions runtime.** Change the reported runtime to a supported Google Cloud Functions runtime ID (see the replacement).
2. **Align other runtime surfaces.** Update every other Terraform google_cloudfunctions*_function runtime and deploy configuration that still pins the old runtime ID.

**Verification**

- `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`: Initialize without touching remote state and check that the configuration is valid.
- `terraform plan`: Review the plan and confirm the runtime change is the intended one.
