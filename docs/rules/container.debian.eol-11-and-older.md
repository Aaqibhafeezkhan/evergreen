## Sources

- [Debian LTS](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS)
- [Debian Releases](https://www.debian.org/releases/)

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Keep the base image and deployment manifests that use debian on one supported Debian release line.
- Confirm the application and its dependencies work on the target Debian release.

**Steps**

1. **Update the base image.** Change the reported FROM line or Compose image to a tag on a supported release line, and pin it to a digest if your policy requires.
2. **Align other image references.** Update other Dockerfiles, Compose files, CI service containers, and deployment manifests that use the same image so they agree.

**Verification**

- `docker build .`: Build the image on the new base.
- `docker run --rm IMAGE sh -c 'echo ok'`: Confirm the container starts on the new base.
