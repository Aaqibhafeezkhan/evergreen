# Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL 9.6 through 12 are in extended support

**End of support** as of 2025-02-01. Replacement: PostgreSQL 14 or later. Source: [Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database versions and version policies](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/db-versions).

Check a version:

```bash
evergreen check pkg:generic/google-cloud-sql-postgresql
```

The Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL version policy lists PostgreSQL 9.6, 10, 11, and 12 with extended support starting 2025-02-01 and deprecation on 2028-02-01. The PostgreSQL community no longer supports those majors, and Cloud SQL charges for extended support.

## Migration

**Constraints**

- Cloud SQL moves an instance to extended support when the PostgreSQL community reaches end of life. Extended support is time-boxed to three years and is charged from 2025-05-01.
- Changing database_version can upgrade the instance in place or recreate it, depending on the target. Read the plan before applying and take a backup first.
- A major version upgrade cannot be reversed by changing database_version back; restore the backup instead.

**Steps**

1. **Back up the instance.** Take an on-demand backup of every Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance reported, before changing its major version.
2. **Upgrade the instance.** Upgrade the instance to PostgreSQL 14 or later with Cloud SQL's in-place major version upgrade, or restore the backup into a new instance on the replacement major and move the application connection string.
3. **Raise the declared version.** Change database_version in every google_sql_database_instance and google_sql_source_representation_instance block that runs this database, using the POSTGRES_ prefix for the replacement major.
4. **Check clients and extensions.** Update PostgreSQL drivers, ORMs, extensions, and any maintenance or backup automation that names the old major version.

**Verification**

- `terraform validate`: Check that the Terraform configuration is valid with the new database_version.
- `terraform plan`: Review the plan and confirm the database_version change is intended and is the only instance change.
- `gcloud sql instances list --format="table(name,databaseVersion)"`: Confirm each reported instance now reports a supported PostgreSQL database version.
- `docker compose config`: Confirm any local Compose service that mirrors this database is valid and uses a PostgreSQL image tag that matches the replacement.
